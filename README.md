## Task description
- The aim of this exercise is to design and deploy production-ready (in terms of reliability,
  security, and efficiency) Kubernetes cluster hosting system of ownCloud services hereinafter
  referred to as system services.
- The system should be composed of software components and publicly available images
  encapsulating services necessary to implement the following features.

## Solution
<h3>Following features have been implemented:</h3>

- [x] system services are available at the dedicated DNS name or at least exposed locally
- [x] all configuration is contained in a dedicated namespace
- [x] database service is not available from outside the cluster
- [x] data persistence is ensured (i.e. data is stored independently of the system services
  container(s))
- [x] system services instances are multiplied to achieve basic availability
- [x] basic cluster monitoring is deployed (e.g. Kuberbetes Dashboard)

## Implementation

### Following kubectl commands aliases were set for the sake of simplicity:
| Alias | Command |
| --------- | ---------|
| kget | kubectl get |
| klogs | kubectl logs |
| kpods | kget pods |
| kdelete | kubectl delete |
| kdeletef | kubectl delete -f |
| kapply | kubectl apply -f |
| krestart | kubectl rollout restart |
| kdrestart | krestart deployment |

### Using prepared yaml configuration files, following main kubernetes components have been created:
1. Deployment + service - owncloud
2. StatefulSet + service - mariadb
3. Ingress


### Namespace

All kubernetes components were placed in a new **my-cloud** namespace created from [init.yaml](https://github.com/Ismail11270/AEII_2020_MSK_-Ismoil_Atajanov-/blob/master/owncloud/init.yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: my-cloud
  labels:
    name: my-cloud
```
With ease of namespaces management in mind, **kubens** tool was installed and set to **my-cloud** as the default namespace.

<br/>


### Storage

For storing the data NFS Persistence Volume was configured. <br/>
Nfs server was set up locally on the same machine using nfs-kernel-server.
/private directory was created with 777 access parameters and exported:
<br/>
![etc/exports](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ismail11270/AEII_2020_MSK_-Ismoil_Atajanov-/master/screenshots/etc-exports.png)
<br/>
Commands to export nfs directory and start nfs server: <br/>
```shell
sudo exportfs -arvf
sudo systemctl start nfs-kernel-server
```
#### Persistence Volume and Persistence Volume Claim
#### Volume configuration file for PV & PVC using NFS Storage [storage.yaml](https://github.com/Ismail11270/AEII_2020_MSK_-Ismoil_Atajanov-/blob/master/owncloud/storage/storage.yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-owncloud
  namespace: my-cloud
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle
  storageClassName: nfs
  mountOptions:
    - hard
    - nfsvers=4.1
  nfs:
    path: /private
    server: 192.168.0.24
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-owncloud
  namespace: my-cloud
spec:
  storageClassName: nfs
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

### As a result following PV and PVC resources were created:
![pv/pvc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ismail11270/AEII_2020_MSK_-Ismoil_Atajanov-/master/screenshots/etc-exports.png)
<br/>
##### Created volume was used further in implementation to mount volumes for the database and owncloud.

### Database configuration
MariaDB was chosen as the main database server, and it was implemented as a single replica stateful application defined in [mariadb.yaml]()
<br/>

- MariaDB username and password were defined in [**mariadb-secret.yaml**](https://github.com/Ismail11270/AEII_2020_MSK_-Ismoil_Atajanov-/blob/master/owncloud/storage/mariadb-secret.yaml)
- MariaDB environment variables were defined in [**config-map.yaml**](https://github.com/Ismail11270/AEII_2020_MSK_-Ismoil_Atajanov-/blob/master/owncloud/storage/config.yaml)
- MariaDB application configuration was defined in [**mariadb.yaml**](https://github.com/Ismail11270/AEII_2020_MSK_-Ismoil_Atajanov-/blob/master/owncloud/storage/mariadb.yaml)
>In order to configure the database correctly **all the configurations** must be applied *in the same order*

####Previously created persistent volume claim is used here to mount volume for mariadb database.
```yaml
        volumeMounts:
          - name: storage
            mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
            subPath: mysql
        volumes:
          - name: storage
            persistentVolumeClaim:
              claimName: pvc-owncloud
```

### Owncloud configuration
- In order to start only single configuration [owncloud.yaml](https://github.com/Ismail11270/AEII_2020_MSK_-Ismoil_Atajanov-/blob/master/owncloud/owncloud.yaml) is required.
  <br/>

Most important part of the configuration is the container image which was set to ***owncloud*** and volume mounts suggested by the official
documentation for the image. Volume mounts are again mounted on the PVC created earlier:
```yaml
        volumeMounts:
          - name: owncloud-storage
            mountPath: /var/www/html/data
            subPath: owncloud/data
        volumeMounts:
          - name: owncloud-storage
            mountPath: /var/www/html/apps
            subPath: owncloud/apps
        volumeMounts:
          - name: owncloud-storage
            mountPath: /var/www/html/config
            subPath: owncloud/config
        volumes:
          - name: owncloud-storage
            persistentVolumeClaim:
              claimName: pvc-owncloud
```

- Owncloud application can be easily re-scaled using `kubectl scale deployment owncloud --replicas=5`

![rescaling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ismail11270/AEII_2020_MSK_-Ismoil_Atajanov-/master/screenshots/scaling_oc.png)
<br/>

#### The two created applications (deployment and statefulset) were created together with internal services to provide access to the pods
![resources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ismail11270/AEII_2020_MSK_-Ismoil_Atajanov-/master/screenshots/resources.png)
<br/>

### Ingress
Next step of the implementation was to configure nginx ingress to provide external access to owncloud service.
The host for the owncloud service access was set to ***my-cloud.site***. After applying the ingress.yaml configuration owncloud application was exposed at the given host.

- Ingress rules
```yaml
  rules:
    - host: my-cloud.site
      http:
        paths:
          - path: "/"
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: owncloud
                port:
                  number: 80
```
### Kubernetes Dashboard
Kubernetes dashboard resources come together with minikube installation. To use them a number of minikube addons have to be enabled.
- Below is the list of all minikube addons enabled for this project:

![addons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ismail11270/AEII_2020_MSK_-Ismoil_Atajanov-/master/screenshots/addons.png)
<br/>
#### Dashboard ingress
As dashboard service exists in a different namespace ( kubernetes-dasboard ), a new [dashboard-ingress.yaml](https://github.com/Ismail11270/AEII_2020_MSK_-Ismoil_Atajanov-/blob/master/owncloud/dashboard-ingress.yaml)
was created to configure an external host to access the dashboard service. The service was exposed at host ***dashboard.my-cloud.size***.

#### DNS Domain names
- After ingress configurations were applied both of them can be view using `kubectl get ingress` command

![ingress](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ismail11270/AEII_2020_MSK_-Ismoil_Atajanov-/master/screenshots/ingress.png)
<br/>

- However, in order for this to work the hosts have to be added to /etc/hosts to be resolved properly by DNS.

![etc/hosts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ismail11270/AEII_2020_MSK_-Ismoil_Atajanov-/master/screenshots/etc-hosts.png)
<br/>

### Results:
- After all the steps completion ***owncloud*** service is available at [my-cloud.site]() and ***dashboard*** at [dashboard.my-cloud.site]()
  ![owncloud/loginpage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ismail11270/AEII_2020_MSK_-Ismoil_Atajanov-/master/screenshots/owncloud-login.png)
  <br/>

> To start using owncloud one has to provide credentials and select preferred database and db credentials, which in the case are mariadb/mysql.

![owncloud/mainpage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ismail11270/AEII_2020_MSK_-Ismoil_Atajanov-/master/screenshots/owncloud-main.png)
<br/>

> After log in, main page of owncloud appears, and the application is ready to use at this point.

![owncloud/dashboardpage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ismail11270/AEII_2020_MSK_-Ismoil_Atajanov-/master/screenshots/dashboard-page.png)
<br/>

> Dashboard page is also present and functional at [dashboard.my-cloud.site]()
